<p><em>Lead me from Unreal to Real</em><br />
<em>Lead me from Darkness to Light</em><br />
<em>Lead me from Death to Immortality</em></p>
<p>Among all the responsibilities you have, the most important one is the one you tend to neglect, or overlook frequently, thanks to the neurotic mind that possesses you.</p>
<p>And that is the responsibility you have toward your own soul.</p>
<p>Your soul (<em>the bright spiritual power that sparkles inside you</em> ) yearns to achieve its ultimate liberation, provided the dump of physical memory, intellect and emotions (that is collectively referred to as <em>you</em>) does not get in the way.</p>
<p>Without first being responsible to yourself, it is futile to try and be responsible to other matters, including your family, work or society. Remember what they tell you to do in case of an emergency inside a flight? You must first wear your own oxygen mask before attempting to help someone with theirs.</p>
<p>You are being responsible to yourself only when you commit to performing sadhana (aka spiritual practice) on a daily basis. You rationalize that you cannot spare 2 * 21 minutes in a day because you just have <em>too</em> many urgent and important things to do. Beware! That's how your mind fights your resolve to help your own soul. Totally fake! Don't fall for it.</p>
<p>Stop being neurotic. Stop allowing <em>you</em> from giving the soul what it rightfully deserves. Do your daily sadhana without fail. Attend to your most important responsibility of being attentive to what your soul needs, and all other parts of your life will fall in place, eventually and almost <em>magically</em>. Take my word for it!</p>
<p>Start and stay on your journey to becoming intensely alive!</p>
<p>Om Shanti. Om Nama Sivaya. Hari Om!</p>
