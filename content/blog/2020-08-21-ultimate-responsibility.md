<!-- title: The Ultimate Responsibility -->

_Lead me from Unreal to Real_  
_Lead me from Darkness to Light_  
_Lead me from Death to Immortality_  

Among all the responsibilities you have, the most important one is the one you tend to neglect, or overlook frequently, thanks to the neurotic mind that possesses you.

And that is the responsibility you have toward your own soul.

Your soul (_the bright spiritual power that sparkles inside you_ ) yearns to achieve its ultimate liberation, provided the dump of physical memory, intellect and emotions (that is collectively referred to as _you_) does not get in the way.

Without first being responsible to yourself, it is futile to try and be responsible to other matters, including your family, work or society. Remember what they tell you to do in case of an emergency inside a flight? You must first wear your own oxygen mask before attempting to help someone with theirs.

You are being responsible to yourself only when you commit to performing sadhana (aka spiritual practice) on a daily basis. You rationalize that you cannot spare 2 * 21 minutes in a day because you just have too many things to do. Totally fake! That's how your mind fights your resolve to help your own soul. Don't fall for it.

Stop being neurotic. Stop allowing _you_ from giving the soul what it rightfully deserves. Do your daily sadhana without fail. Attend to your most important responsibility of being attentive to what your sould needs, and all other parts of your life will almost _magically_ fall in place. Take my word for it!

Start and stay on your journey to becoming intensely alive!

Om Shanti. Om Nama Sivaya. Hari Om!
