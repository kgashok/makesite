All nice and rhyming, Henry Ford. But how the bloody fuck do we come together, keep together and work together? 
  - Firstly, by having conversations about shared values to arrive at shared understanding
  - Secondly, by translating that shared understanding into shared words 
  - Fortunately, that exercise has been completed at KGCAS and KITE as a CMVO document (culture-mission-vision-objectives). Please review and align yourself to that document, especially the ```culture``` part of it

## W.I.N.ning Attitude -> Worskship, Improvement and NoArrogance

In this, the central thing and non-negotiable thing is improvement (*aka* productivity at the national level). If you improve,  your nation improves. If your nation improves, mankind improves. Workship and no arrogance are not easily measurable by the outside world. Improvement is measurable. What is measurable is manageable. What is measurable is also rewarded. 

# Question for Improvement 
Simply, are you a better human being compared to yesterday? 

## KGISL and what it stands for!

### Post-pandemic : inclusive compassion 

To tackle the rather dangerous ```increasing inequality``` in the world
 
	- Man vs Environment 
	- Man vs Nature
	- Man vs Man

### Top .01% in the world
- And how about getting to be among the top .01% of the world - and while we arrive there, first to gain them as our clients for our services? 


### "Ask me what the "i" stands for in KGiSL"

**tl;dr** The i stands for an invite to come join us, and become yourself, the super human that you are.

_I am becoming God-driven, and aspire for God mode to become God-like! And so I cherish the god-given sacred privilege to gratefully inspire at KG! I shall ask for no other blessing!_
> நான் கடவுளால் இயக்கப்படுகிறேன், கடவுளைப் போல ஆக கடவுளின் பயன்முறையை விரும்புகிறேன்! எனவே, கே.ஜி.க்கு நன்றியுடன் ஊக்கமளிக்க கடவுள் கொடுத்த புனித பாக்கியத்தை நான் மதிக்கிறேன்! வேறு எந்த ஆசீர்வாதத்தையும் நான் கேட்க மாட்டேன்!

It stands for YOU the INDIVIDUAL, who has chosen to be with us, of considering to partner with us. We are first and foremost grateful for that choice. We are grateful for the privilege to engage with your genius to make our unique contribution to the world, to make that meaningful dent in the Universe.

KG```i```SL the i in the middle stands for diruptive ```I```nnovation  
W```i```N the i in the middle stands for quantum ```I```mprovement  
SM```i```LE the i in the middle stands for focused intense ```I```nvolvement  

Become intensely involved to improve to innovate for a better future for yourself, your team and your organisation. 

BECOMEing you is all about - Behavior (intensely habits driven not mind driven); Commitment (focused on closing out on high pressure short term goals made to your mentors) and Environment (energize yourself, and surround yourself with people who will energize you). 

BECOME. You. BECOME. You. Repeat.
That is progress. That is prosperity. That is peace.

> I am becoming God-driven, aspiring for God mode to become God-like! Therefore, I cherish the god-given sacred privilege to gratefully inspire at KG!

Namaskaram. Om Shanti. Hari OM!

### Slogan
Customers choose us for our reliability. They endorse us for our responsiveness. Translate this to your specific context: 

## KGH 
- Patients choose us for *reliable* safety. They endorse us for the medical outcomes. Therefore, the core metric for management is about how we eliminate errors (technical, human and systemic).  For the metric to make quantum and accelerated jumps, 
	- we need to move from consultant based practice to patient centric participatory approach
		- So many undiagnosed diseases, why not compile a database on this and address this need of the hour?
	- we need to become aware of the distance between us and the frontiers of medical practice, and rapidly close the gap. 
		- no diagnosis by a doctor or team of doctors is perfect
		- With AI-assisted diagnosis, the diagnosis has the potential to become perfect
			- and therefore eliminate that extra one more error 

Core mission: "Do no evil" -  Translated to Eliminate errors, big and small, because even one error can possible cause the loss of a loved one. 

## KG Edu

Customers choose us for our *reliability*. They endorse us for our responsiveness.
Translate this to your specific *context* at KG. 

- Students choose us for the **reliable** learning experience *that transforms*. They endorse us for who *they* become.
