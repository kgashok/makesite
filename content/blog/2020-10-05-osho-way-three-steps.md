## How to get to the Centre


_People come as investigators_  
_Then they become students_  
_Then they become disciples and then eventually_   
_They become devotees_  
_As their journey inward, deepens!_  
  - [Sadhguru](https://youtu.be/Tbha9WYxcg4) 


... and if you are still unconvinced, listen to [Osho](https://youtu.be/6i8bnb4dvvg)

**tl;dr** - keep observing your actions, thoughts and emotions as a bystander, and the 4th step "Quantum Leap" shall happen ***automagically***. 

1. Observing all your activities 
   - Your body, your action
   - Don't do it like a robot 
2. Watch the activities of your mind 
   - thoughts, dreams, imagination
      - Don't make judgments - just like you are standing by the road, watching a procession
      - Just like a mirror does not say "Beautiful face" or "My God! Ugly face" 
      - Become a pure witness, no evaluation of good or bad
      - 10% of witness, 90% of thoughts
      - 90% of witness, 10% thoughts
3. At 100% witness
	4. Doorstep to the 3rd step 
	5. "Moods" - a certain shadow of sadness, joy 
	6. Watch the third - related to the "heart"

Eventually, you will enter the 4th stage. Ultimate ecstascy. Samadhi. Enlightenment.  Consciousness is aware of itself. There is no way to go beyond it - You have come home! 

This needs no belief. It only needs experimentation. I want you to experiment and experience the experiment. 

You are still asleep. I am just awake. 
No need to worship me. I will stand a guarantee, I will be your encouragement, I will not be your saviour. I will do my best to shake you and wake you up! 

**Tomorrow Never Comes** 

_[Sadhguru](https://www.facebook.com/IshaUSA/videos/1531261760256590/?v=1531261760256590) shares his poem about tomorrow and speaks about tomorrow as an idea, not a reality. This moment is the only reality. Tomorrow never happened to anybody but the idea of tomorrow has robbed a huge mass of people of their life._
  
A day that never came but has managed to spoil every game  
One day that takes all the blame, the basis of all fear and shame  
Cripples the blossoming of the life’s flame  
A spoiler that makes life a dream  
Traps the limitless in a limited scene  
One day that takes all the blame, the basis of all fear and shame  
Cripples the blossoming of life’s flame  
A spoiler that makes life a dream  
Traps the limitless in a limited scene  
A day that never comes but the world it rules  
A day that never comes but the world it rules.
