## How to get to the Centre

Listen to [Osho](https://youtu.be/6i8bnb4dvvg)

Three steps are required, and the 4th step "Quantum Leap" happens automatically. 

1. Observing all your activities 
   - Your body, your action
   - Don't do it like a robot 
2. Watch the activities of your mind 
   - thoughts, dreams, imagination
      - Don't make judgments - just like you are standing by the road, watching a procession
      - Just like a mirror does not say "Beautiful face" or "My God! Ugly face" 
      - Become a pure witness, no evaluation of good or bad
      - 10% of witness, 90% of thoughts
      - 90% of witness, 10% thoughts
3. At 100% witness
	4. Doorstep to the 3rd step 
	5. "Moods" - a certain shadow of sadness, joy 
	6. Watch the third - related to the "heart"

Eventually, you will enter the 4th stage. Ultimate ecstascy. Samadhi. Enlightenment.  Consciousness is aware of itself. There is no way to go beyond it - You have come home! 

This needs no belief. It only needs experimentation. I want you to experiment and experience the experiment. 

You are still asleep. I am just awake. 
No need to worship me. I will stand a guarantee, I will be your encouragement, I will not be your saviour. I will do my best to shake you and wake you up!
