Melvin Udall:  I've got a really great compliment for you, and it's true.

Carol Connelly:  I'm so afraid you're about to say something awful.

Well, my compliment to you is, the next morning, I started taking the pills.

### A Better Soul

Just listening to the devotion in Jahnvi Harrison's voice in [http://j.mp/hareKirshna6](http://j.mp/hareKrishna6) will make you want to be a better soul.  And listen often enough, it may transform you into that rarest of souls as inspired by [Chapter 7, Verse 3, Gita](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/7/verse/3)

> _Amongst thousands of persons, hardly one strives for perfection; and amongst those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows me in truth._
