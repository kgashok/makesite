<!-- title: Stop Judging -->

## Judge less, Understand more

Can u judge who is the better person out of these 3?..🤔

- Mr A - He had friendship with bad politicians, consults astrologers, two wives, chain smoker, drinks eight to 10 times a day..🤨
- Mr B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps till noon, used opium in college & drinks whiskey every evening..😟
- Mr C - He is a decorated war hero, a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink  and never cheated on his wife..😁

You would say Mr.C - right?

But..
- Mr. A was Franklin Roosevelt! ( 32nd President of the USA) 
- Mr. B was Winston Churchill!! (Former British Prime Minister)
- Mr C Was ADOLF HITLER!!! 

Strange but true..
Its risky to judge anyone by his habits ! Character is a complex phenomenon..🤗

So every person in ur life is important, don't judge them, accept them..🤪 
  - ...The same Boiling Water that hardens the Egg, will Soften the Potato!
  - It depends upon Individual's reaction To stressful circumstances!..🤔

Enjoy "The Journey" called Life..👆👌
