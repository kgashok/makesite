## Goals and habits

Consistent habits need an anchor in the form of a motivated goal. In my case, I had two goals and they were achieved by consistent habits. 

After the physician at AIG Hyderabad warned me that I might have to take medication for life, or lose 10% of my body weight, that was a "negative" goal which inspired me to adopt the Amura's way of losing weight. I had to get into the habit of consistently saying no to sugar. Along the way, I also learnt that I could fast for 72 hours and still survive! 

Thanks to Sadhguru's constant persuasion and inspiration, I decided to explore the spiritual dimension of life by travelling inward. I adopted the Shambavi MahaMudra sadhana for 40 consecutive days, twice a day. I believe that I have sensed a indescribable yet fleeting sense of peacefulness as part of rather chaotic psyche. Continued daily sadhana for the next 6 months should only deepen that sense of inner joy. 

Om Nama Sivaya!
Hari Om!
