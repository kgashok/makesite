<!-- title: Pandemic Lessons  -->

## The Humbling Pandemic and what has it taught you? 

What started off as a playful expression of solidarity with those who went hungry during the pandemic, my hacking with food and fasting (#zeroFoodIsGenius) has been quite empowering and enlightening. 

As Amura's Saravanan said it very aptly, "The less food, the better" is gold. I will like to add to it, as "The less the sugar, the better!". 

### The Science of Fasting 

And some Japanese scholar has recently won a Nobel prize for his work on Autophagy (another fancy name for fasting, I presume), something else also emerged inside me. How many more such endorsements of past Indian traditional practice will have to be exposed to us for us Indians to start appreciating our precious tradition? 

## The Science of Focus 

I have purchased and partially consumed Calport's three books including Digital Minimalism, and how our ability to stay focused on what we need to get done will depend upon adopting some digital fasting as well. A "Life of Focus" is also a program I enrolled in, and yet to digest all the material, let alone put it into practice. 

## The Science of Fate

When Sadhguru says, "Don't look down upon anyone. Don't look up to anyone", I did not fully subscribe to it fully. After all, how can you not look at Elon Musk's brilliant entrepreneurial efforts and feel slightly inadequate? The book by Hannah Critchlow "The Science of Fate" is something that is worth your time. The first chapter conveyed to me the importance of Yoga and how that is the best way to put distance between you and the physiology and the genetic inheritance that you are born with. 

So, in summary, The Science of Fasting, Focus and Fate are my biggest takeaways from the Pandemic, and I have a sense of fulfillment that I have not let a crisis go for a waste. 

In closing, I leave with you the Saint Vallalaar's magic three words mantra 

> "பசித்திரு, தனித்திரு, விழித்திரு!"

Thank you for your attention.
