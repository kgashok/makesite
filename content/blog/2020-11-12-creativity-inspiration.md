<!-- title: Creativity and Inspiration  -->

## Elizabeth Gilbert

What is Creativity? It is the relationship between a human being and the mysteries of inspiration. 

From the "Big Magic" book. Very fascinating read. Especially the 2nd chapter of "Enhanting". And her concept of Ideas. And how they are there to be taken up for partnerships. 

Also, Genius is not that of "being", but that of "had". 
It does not belong to you, you have it for some time, and it goes on its way.
