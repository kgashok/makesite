## Renewed Co-Kreation in 2021

tl;dr1 Come alive and **co-Kreate** at KG

tl;dr2 _Privileged Workshippers, inspired to impact, to co-Kreate Geniuses, to maximize transformation._ 

Hello Impact Workshippers, 

On this New Year, let us remind ourselves that we are privileged and inspired to co-Kreate Geniuses, to maximize transformation. In other words, we are all about

```co-Kreating (K) Geniuses (G)```

KGiSL Education is an invite to you to come collaborate with a team of  dedicated faculty and motivated peers; to co-create new knowledge (including ideas and skills), primarily through hackathons.  That ```Kreation``` shall be the start of a lifelong confidence-building self-learning journey to discovering your unique genius. That genius will manifest you as a self-made crorepati (`1,00,00,000`) for your family. As you progress towards the right side of ```90% === .01%``` or even earlier, you shall eventually visit as the alumni who generously contributes to keep KITE soaring high, as the ```MIT``` for India! 

Remember, students choose us for the **reliable** learning experience that *transforms*. They endorse us for who *they* become.
