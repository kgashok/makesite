<!-- title: Make a Deal with God  -->

## Yearn for a Higher Love

Here's my weird theory of God's vulnerability. Basically,  I'm convinced that He is a very lonely Soul in the immense vastness of this limitless  Universe. And the moment he sense even an iota of true yearning for Him in the hearts of living souls, He gravitates towards them. 
  - "Not true!" - well, that's your perspective. And besides, _who_ are you to say I am wrong? Until proven wrong, my cockeyed theory is as good any of the theories that have come mind, including those written and preached for thousands of years by hundred of seers. 

For a moment, case aside all your neurosis and accept my premise. I have a very actionable and powerful lifehack for you  to try (what do you have to lose?): Make a deal with Him that you will spend time thinking of Him. In return, that He has to grant you some things that you _want_. 
  - Be very clear as to what you will ask for, because it will come true even before you know it. Make sure what you want is what you _need_. There is a big difference. Don't ask for what you _want_. Instead, ask for what you _need_. 

Sit back and enjoy the magic unfold in front of your own eyes! And if it does work, reach out to me and buy me a Bugatti.
