1. The one-inch leverage

 
Just one inch of pillow helped me to stay focused on completing my 40-mandala of SMM yoga. What a difference, between night and day! I am feeling more settled during the entire sadhana...

 
2. The every-minute-planning experience

  

I am going to schedule every single minute of my day for a couple of days.

And see how productive that becomes. This again comes from my own motivation to do the SMM yoga at the twilight zones. Need to plan my mornings properly.  

  

3. Seeing things for what they are

  

Problems persist and are not addressed over 5 years. And they become insurmountable like mountains. Stop lamenting about them or pointing fingers are people who might be causing them. Rather, face the issues head-on. They can be reduced to molehills by chipping away at the base. With enormous patience, for over a duration of not longer than you let the problem fester along.

Example - with the right diet, whatever weight one gained over 25 years, it can be ceded in less than 6 months. New insight, new mentoring, a new approach, new motivation, new inspiration - things fall into place.
