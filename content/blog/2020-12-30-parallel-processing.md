## Parallel processing in Life

Aka multi-tasking. I have read in multiple places, it is not healthy to do this. 

But here's how I do it, and enjoy it.

1. While my French press coffee is brewing for 5 minutes, I go out into the green lawn laden with the morning mist, barefoot and ground myself. While it can be rather boring to simple stand, I do a simple vertical stretch, which again puts pressure on my soles, which improves the grounding. Coffee brews, deep breathing of clean morning air, grounding achieved, stretch done. In the same 5 minutes, I get three things accomplished. 
2. When I have to be in the loo performing my bowel movements, I take a book with me to read some pages of it. This way, I have begun my 5-10 minute read for the day. Bowel movement achieved, reading quota achieved for the day.

That's what I call parallel processing. You call it multi-tasking. Both the same.   
I say to-MA-to, you say to-MAH-to. Both the same. 

Cheers,
