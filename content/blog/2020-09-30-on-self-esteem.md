## It is your business

Sadhguru: It is your [business](http://j.mp/businessYours)!

Officially (as per yogic sciences): 
  - if your body becomes Pleasant we call this health 
  - if it becomes very pleasant we call it pleasure
  - if your mind becomes Pleasant we call this peace
  - if it becomes very pleasant we call it joy 
  - if your emotions become Pleasant we call it love 
  - if it becomes very pleasant we call it compassion 
  - if your very life energies become Pleasant we call this blissfulness
  - if it becomes very pleasant we call it ecstasy 
  - if your if your surroundings become Pleasant we call this **success** 

Only for this last one: To make our surroundings Pleasant we need
the cooperation of many forces around us; many things have to fall into place.  
  - But to keep your body Pleasant mind Pleasant emotion Pleasant your life energy is pleasant it's 100 percent of your business" 
  - It will not be good for "the business" (of pharmaceuticals)
