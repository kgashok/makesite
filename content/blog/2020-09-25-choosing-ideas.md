<!-- title: Ideas to focus on -->

## Prioritizing ideas that would benefit most from your focus

- Be frustrated that you are not doing the right kind of work that you should be doing
- Be unsure of how to choose what you should focus on 
- it is not all easy to figure out about your big roles 
	- it is not easy to define the sub-projects should be 
	- there is no shortcut / process it, think about it, cognitive integration that requires time alone with your thoughts 

- Journalling 
	- even if you are not a writer - writing is very powerful, you are overcoming the working memory limitation - extra buffer to hold ideas 
	  - write about all your frustration and thoughts in a journal setting for 20 minutes - I was really confused about this 

- have a pocket notebook / fancy pin / Jack brand / should come with you / lifeBook / above tasks / what should I be doing in my life 
	 - different notebooks / different homes / a theme that I want to explore. Monthly go through your physical book and transfer into the digital permanent system / takes about 1 hour every month

- Smartphones accidentally got rid off the time when you could be thinking, understanding what went wrong, what that means, what are you happy about, what are you unhappy about
  - record of reflection of being alone with your thoughts
  - you lose an opportunity to achieve self understanding
