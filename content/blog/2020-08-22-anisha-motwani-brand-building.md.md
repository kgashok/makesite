# Brand Building

- output is an art
- process is a science 

## 3 parts 

"You can't top pigs with pigs!"

### Trust Code

#### Old companies 
 - Lineage/heritage  
 - Size  
 - Honesty   

#### New age companies 

- Performance / Efficiency 
- Differentiation (topping pigs with pigs, NOT)
- Reliability 

Trust has become very fragile...

## Branding, Marketing, Advert

- branding is about creating a pull
	- strategic marketing
- marketing is about creating a push 
	- tactile marketing

### Branding

- It is what they talk about you when you are not in the room! 
- What is the 3 words that captures what your brand means
	- you are not building your brand if you just advertise with a problem statement in mind
