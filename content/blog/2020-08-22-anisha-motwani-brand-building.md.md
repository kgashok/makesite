<!-- title: Anisha Motwani on Brand Building -->

# Brand Building

- output is an art
- process is a science 

## 3 parts 

"You can't top pigs with pigs!"

### Trust Code

#### Old companies 
 - Lineage/heritage  
 - Size  
 - Honesty   

#### New age companies 

- Performance / Efficiency 
- Differentiation (topping pigs with pigs, NOT)
- Reliability 

Trust has become very fragile...

## Branding, Marketing, Advert

- branding is about creating a pull
	- strategic marketing
- marketing is about creating a push 
	- tactile marketing

### Branding

- It is what they talk about you when you are not in the room! 
- What is the 3 words that captures what your brand means
	- you are not building your brand if you just advertise with a problem statement in mind 


## Brand Journey

- why do you exist? Reason for being? 
	- if you don't exist tomorrow, who will it impact and how? 
	- craft your purpose 
		- "our purpose is to give happiness to families" - Disney

- "Make India defecation free"
	- how do you do it? 
		- stakeholders - women
		- village panchayat heads 
		- 300,000 lives have been saved - 4 years in the running 

- Aravind was inspired by McDonald
	- why can't we Mcdonaldize the eye care - now only Rs 800 - to give site to everybody? 
		- if you pay Rs 2500 - you can fund the operation of two other patients 
		- 100 surgeries in a day 

Volvo - how they have positioned themselves as the "SAFE CAR"
	- when they are willing to buy, think only about "safety"

- use a car crash survivor to become the salesperson 
-  a parking space in the mind of the customer? which one have you occupied? 

POSITIONING - is one or two words. It is your emotions or feelings or words that are invoked when you speak about it 
	- that's your filter
	- do you want to change it
	- it is a journey - but begin it 

### Storm the Norm Way
