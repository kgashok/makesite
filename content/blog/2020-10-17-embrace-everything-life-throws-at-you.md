## The Life Embrace 

_"..too often, so many words are uttered that offer so little for so few. And that I shall strive to steer clear off in my writing."_

You have three distinct choices. 

1. Complain and be frustrated about what happens in your life. It can be very disempowering and does not help you think and feel good about your situation. Very likely things will spiral down and put you in a very dark space that is worth not living at all. 

2. Be relaxed and settle comfortable into the blessed life that you have been given. However, a niggling lurking fear makes you feel "small" and act "small" at the slightest adversity that comes your way. But overall, you stay in your comfort zone, and hopefully coast through life, thanks to your previous birth karma? But here's a fair warning though: if you are not careful, you might end up being part of the LivingDead (aka people who are very dull and boring) tribe. Seriously, is that all you want in life? 

3. *Bravely* step out of your comfort zone, and face everything that gets thrown at you by [Life, the Universe and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_the_Universe_and_Everything); and in the process get ready to be chewed up and get thrown around by the  trials and tribulations of life. Give no quarter to the challenges that come your way and like Valluvar said "Give problems to the problems" and be determined to be bigger than the obstacles and ultimately prevail over it. 
	- this kind of thinking or attitude should make you feel empowered. Don't be feeble and avoid life. Step up to the plate and get ready to smash or be smashed. Either way, there is no shame. Nobody will care in 100 years how badly you fucked it up or how well you hit it out of the park. 


```LIFE'S EMBRACE```
	 
 - Embrace every emotion, every event, every specimen of a human being that comes down the pipeline of Life. Truly embrace _everything_ without an iota of judgment. The good, the bad, the ugly, the grim, the gruelling, the bleak, the brutal, the unforgiving and every shade of gray in between! The more desperate the rumble and tumble of the situation, the more tighter and bigger your embrace becomes. Unbeknown to you, it surely and slowly transforms into a **big bear hug** which in turn morphs into an unrelenting bone-crushing body lock which eventually breaketh that adversity's spine.  And then, almost magically, you begin to sense a deeper peace to live in anticipation of more positive outcomes (#LIAPO)  
 - And before you know it you realize that it is _your time to  exit_ this increasingly wretched world. And whenever that happens, you must be able look back and at yourself and say,  _"**F#@&, bro**! What a ride it has been! I am all chewed up and in tatters. But what the hell, I chose the roller coasters and the wild trails that I wanted to ride, and had a great time doing it!_ 
- Hari OM!   🙏
