<!-- title: Life Embrace  -->

## The Life Embrace 

You have three distinct choices. 


1. Complain and be frustrated about what happens in your life. It can be very disempowering and does not help you think and feel good about your situation. Very likely things will spiral down and put you in a very dark room that is worth not living at all. 

2. Be relaxed and settle comfortable into the blessed life that you have been given. A lurking fear makes you feel "small" and act "small" when you are not enjoying life. But overall, you stay in your comfort zone, and hopefully go through life comfortably. Here's a fair warning though: if you are not careful, you might ending up being part of the LivingDead (aka people who are very dull and boring) tribe. Seriously, is that all you want in life? 

3. *Bravely* step out of your comfort zone, and face everything that gets thrown at you by [Life, the Universe and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_the_Universe_and_Everything); and in the process get ready to be chewed up and get thrown around by the  trials and tribulations of life by . Give no quarter to the challenges that come your own and like Valluvar said "Give problems to the problems" and be determined to be bigger than the obstacles and ultimately prevail over it. 
	- this kind of thinking or attitude should make you feel empowered. Don't be feeble and avoid life. Step up to the plate and get ready to smash or be smashed. Either way, there is no shame. Nobody will care in 100 years how badly you fucked it up or how well you hit it out of the park. 
	  - Embrace every emotion, every event, every specimen of a human being that comes down the pipeline of Life. Embrace _everything_ without judgment. The good, the bad, the ugly, the grim, the gruelling, the bleak, the brutal, the unforgiving and every shade of gray in between! The more desperate the rumble and tumble of the situation, the more tighter and bigger your embrace becomes, until it is one merciless **big bear hug** which breaketh adversity's spine and bones, only to find a deeper peace to live in anticipation of positive outcomes (#PLIAPO)  
	  - And before you know it you realize that it is _your time to  exit_ this increasingly wretched world. And whenever you come up on that threshold, you must look back and and also look at yourself in the mirror and say, 
	    - _"**F#&k, bro**! What a ride it has been! I am all chewed up and in tatters, _but_ what the hell! I chose the roller coasters and the wild trails that I wanted to ride, and had a great time doing it!_ 
	  - Hari OM!
