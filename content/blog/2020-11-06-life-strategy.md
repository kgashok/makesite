## Effortless : Pray to Perumal

1. Please keep me happy
   - God will grant you what _you_ need; not what you think you want 
   - Don't compare what you get - after all, you don't know what you want; it is meaningless to compare yourself to others way of life and lifestyle - even if you had it, it might bring you more misery than happiness that you might want 

3. Create some balance in life - for example, three broad areas and spend time in all three areas 
	- work
	- family
	- friends
 
## Alternative Effortful Approach

1. Ask the right type of questions
	- how to make sure we maintain financial security
	   - living and fleeting with risk ever so slightly 
	   - playing it safe 
	   - a slow death
	- how to think act and execute like a monopolist? 

2. Make some decisions - break away from the past activities 
	- it is okay to go hungry for 72 hours - completely mind blown that my body had the spare calories within it 
	- "less food the better" - new belief 
		- the less sweeter it is, the better 

3. Maintain the discipline to follow through on your decisions 
	- Death by a 1000 cuts 
	- Goal by a 1000 hacks
