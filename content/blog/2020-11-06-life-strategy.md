## Effortless : Pray to Perumal

1. Please keep me happy
2. Divide life into three broad areas and spend time in all three areas 
	- work
	- family
	- friends
 
## Alternative Effortful approach

1. Ask the right type of questions
	- how to make sure we maintain financial security
	   - living and fleeting with risk ever so slightly 
	   - playing it safe 
	   - a slow death
	- how to think act and execute like a monopolist? 

2. Make some decisions - break away from the past activities 
	- it is okay to go hungry for 72 hours - completely mind blown that my body had the spare calories within it 
	- "less food the better" - new belief 
		- the less sweeter it is, the better 

3. Maintain the discipline to follow through on your decisions 
	- death by a 1000 cuts 
	- Goal by a 1000 hacks
