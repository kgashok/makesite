## Effortless : Pray to Perumal

1. Please keep me happy
   - God will grant you what _you_ need; not what you think you want 
   - Don't compare what you get - after all, you don't know what you want; it is meaningless to compare yourself to others way of life and lifestyle - even if you had it, it might bring you more misery than happiness that you might want 
  - less is not more. Less is Less. And that is perfectly fine. Minimalism as a way of life, not as a means to an end but as end in of itself
    - Define what you are not like Mathew does - https://bit.ly/eliminateThis 

3. Create some balance in life - for example, three broad areas and spend time in all three areas 
	- work
	- family
	- friends
 
## Alternative Effortful Approach

1. Ask the right type of questions - intelligent questions, please! 
	- how to make sure we maintain financial security
	   - living and fleeting with risk ever so slightly 
	   - playing it safe 
	   - a slow death
	- how to think act and execute like a monopolist? 
	- Don't ask "How can I be happier?" 
	     - determine what will make you happy, and find out "how can I learn to do it today? Quickly?"

2. Make some decisions - break away from the past activities 
	- it is okay to go hungry for 72 hours - completely mind blown that my body had the spare calories within it 
	- "less food the better" - new belief 
		- the less sweeter it is, the better 

    - "less is less" - LIFE is about FOCUS - don't try to too much, please, it is not good for your heart 


3. Maintain the discipline to follow through on your decisions 
	- Death by a 1000 cuts 
	- Goal by a 1000 hacks 

4. Less is less - like a hobo

> I basically shall aspire to have the material needs of a hobo. Except that I need my organic single estate french press ground coffee to be brewed at ~ 84 Celsius for 4:40 min, no more, no less.
