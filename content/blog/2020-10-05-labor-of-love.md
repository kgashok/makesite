"Humans are capable of sustaining hard labour only over a  short period of time. However, they are capable of tortuous intense labour of love indefinitely, at least in the eyes of the beholder."  *#paradox* 

  - "They found that the oxytocin: the hormone of labor is also the hormone of love. It took no time for oxytocin to acquire fancy names such as “the bonding hormone,” “the cuddle hormone” and even “the love hormone.” And giving meaning to its new founded names, it generated the lust for money and resulted in products like “trust elixir,” an oxytocin-laced perfume being made available in many parts of the world [[http://www.verolabs.com/](http://www.verolabs.com/)]." _#irony_
