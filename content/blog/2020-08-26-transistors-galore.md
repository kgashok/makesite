<!-- title: TIL so many new transistors! -->

Read the article https://bit.ly/transistorThis , very interesting! 

Mind-blown! So many new words, including 
  - [FinFET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFET) (fin field effect) transistor will hand off to
 
  - [Nanowire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junctionless_nanowire_transistor) transistors, while being threatened by  
  - [Nanotube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube_field-effect_transistor) transistors
- 7 nanometer chips - Intel struggling to keep up, which [TSMC](https://bit.ly/tsmcThis) chip maker (and competitor to Intel) is almost bragging about its roadmap to smaller transistors
- clever software tweaks like [these]([https://singularityhub.com/2020/06/08/computing-power-can-keep-growing-as-moores-law-winds-down-heres-how/](https://singularityhub.com/2020/06/08/computing-power-can-keep-growing-as-moores-law-winds-down-heres-how/)) might also provide help
