<!-- title: பசித்திரு, தனித்திரு, விழித்திரு! redux  -->

## Monk's mission

_பசித்திரு, தனித்திரு, விழித்திரு!_

**பசித்திரு**
  - have been advised to have only two meals a day; as a reminder of people who go hungry in this country, pandemic or otherwise 
  - and must perform fasting once a week for a minimum of 24 hours
  - "The less food, the better" - and "less sweeter, even better" 

**தனித்திரு**
  - have to learn to be alone with my thoughts
	  - journalling in a physical notebook - this is important and then transfer to digital Evernote books when required 
  - have to meditate and perform sadhana every day for the next 60 days, from the initial twice a day 40 day mandalam period 

**விழித்திரு**

The only dimension still to be explored and reviewed as to what needs to be done. Go back to Arunji's note (attached below)? 
   - have to read at least 50 books a year 
   - with the hope of coming up with an original idea which can transform the world into a better place
	   - wicked problems are confronting us in India and it needs solutions, pronto 



### Arun Madhavan Note

Dear Ashok:
Vallalar conveyed a great philosophy in these simple commandments. They are truly three guidelines for the three dimensions of human personality viz. Physical, Mental and Spiritual ; call it Body, Mind and Soul complex.  

  - The body endowed with six senses generates cravings. Fulfillment of one craving leads to the rise of another. “Pasithiru” implies exercising discipline by denying the demands of the body.  
  - The mind, which creates the notion of ego invariably, gets drawn to worldly matters; it needs to be stabilized in a state of equanimity. “Thanithiru” means to remain alone in meditation and to free one’s mind from worldly thoughts.
  - Vizhithiru - Remain awake: Normally, our mind can dwell in three states: Deep sleep, Dream state and wakeful state. During deep sleep state, the supreme consciousness is active while our body, mind / intellect cease to function. In the dream state, the mind forms its own images and takes the individual to a different world.  
    - As he wakes up, his mind, body and intellect start functioning. Though awake, he does not act for his real Self, the Atma; rather he acts in accordance with the dictates of his mind and body. He walks, talks and performs various functions, mechanically as though a sleep-walker. Even on waking up, he remains in deep slumber. Even with his eyes wide open, he is fast asleep. Even on seeing the light of the day, he remains in darkness. He needs to be woken up really and brought to realise the real role and the real goal of his life. 

He whose vision is clear and who is enlightened within, remains really awake. 

Always a delight to hear from you.

Arunji

Vallalar like many illustrious sages in India must have been influenced by the Supreme Yoga called Yog Vasistha. I have enclosed a one-page note from the conversation Vasistha had with Prince Ram at Ayodhya - revealing the way forward to attain liberation..If you Google the sites, you will be amazed that the epic has inspired mega blockbusters like Matrix, Inception and Avatar!
  
4 gate keepers at entrance to the realm of Moksha: A wise seeker should diligently cultivate their friendship.
  
- Self-control
- Spirit of enquiry
- Santosha - Contentment
- Satsangha – Company of the wise
  
### Self control
Who can live on earth itself like God? 

> When one is untouched: 
> by defects of life
> unaffected by past tendencies
> with his mind resting in the eternal
> seeing that pleasure and pain 
> chase and cancel each other
  
### Self Enquiry  
To enquire: `Who am I? How has this evil of samsara, repetitive history, come into being? Knowledge of truth arises from such enquiry; then the supreme peace that helps to overcome all sorrow.
  
The eye of spiritual enquiry does not lose its sight even in the midst of all activities: he who does not have this eye is indeed to be pitied.
  
### Santosha -Contentment
  
As long as one is not satisfied in the Self, he will be subjected to sorrow. With the rise of contentment the purity of one’s heart blooms.
  
The contented man who possesses nothing, owns the world.
  
### Satsanga  
The company of wise, holy and enlightened; it enlarges one’s intelligence, destroys one’s ignorance and psychological distress.
  
Whatever be the cost, whatever obstacles in its way, satsanga should never be neglected. It is superior to all other forms of religious practices like charity, austerity, performance of religious rites and pilgrimage.
