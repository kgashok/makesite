<!-- title: Morning dump -->

1. Sadhguru wants to share the estascy that he feels
2. He says you don't have to be a superman. To be human is super enough. 
3. But you are skeptical of the daily sadhana, understandbly 
4. How can some simple breathing exercise liberate you to Moksha? 
5. But what do you have to lose? 
6. Look at the risk-reward ratio and it is a no brainer. You are risking 20 min of your daily life for a ticket to Liberation and all that magic that lies beyond. What do you have to lose?
