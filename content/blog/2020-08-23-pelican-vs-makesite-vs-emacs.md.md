# SSG
Your pick? Pelican, Makesite or Emacs?

- [Pelican Site Generator](https://blog.getpelican.com/)
- [Makesite](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite)
- [Emacs (editor)](https://bit.ly/emacsBlog) 

## From simple to simplest 

- Pelican took 20 minutes to cofigure. 
- Makesite was just compiling and pushed to `github-pages` manually. Used Github Workflow to automate the deployment to the branch 
- Emacs setup has to be explored quickly
