## Pyment for placeholder docstrings

Thanks to Gupta's [presentation](https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048/status/1307267505115684865?s=20) in a recently concluded Python Flame event on Sept 19 2020 (Saturday), I explored `pyment`. It was rather straightforward. And easy and so did a commit for all the import source files.
