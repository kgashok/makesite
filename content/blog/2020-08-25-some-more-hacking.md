<!-- title: Productive Hacking -->

1. First, got the Tiny Python Projects to work on gitpod and get all the test cases to run 
	2. Use the stock dockerFile provided to build the image 

2. The bigger hack is making PythonTopics deploy to github-pages - [https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pull/2](https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pull/2)

Really productive day.
