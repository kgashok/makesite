<!-- title: Productive Hacking -->

1. First, got the Tiny Python Projects to work on gitpod and get all the test cases to run 
	- Use the stock dockerFile provided to build the image 

2. The bigger hack is making PythonTopics deploy to github-pages - [https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pull/2](https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pull/2)

3. Completed a [PR]([https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pulls](https://github.com/PythonCHB/PythonTopics/pulls)) for the same 

Really productive day.
