<!-- title: Final Edge Questions -->

## Questions, questions

I was curious to build a wordcloud based on [https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question](https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question) using the following JavaScript code: 

```javascript
var err = [], res = ""; for (var x = 2; x <= 285; x++) { 
  var select = document.querySelector("#block-system-main > div:nth-child(" + x + ") > div:nth-child(4) > p > strong");
  if (select === null) {
     select = document.querySelector("#block-system-main > div:nth-child(" + x + 
") > p > strong");  
  }
  if (select === null) {
  var select = document.querySelector("#block-system-main > div:nth-child(" + x + ") > div:nth-child(2) > p > strong"); 
  }
  if (select === null) err.push(x); 
  else {
    console.log(x, select);
    var text = select.textContent.replace(/\?/g,'? ');
    //var text = select.textContent;
    res += text;
  } 
}
console.log(res);
console.log(err.length, err); 
```
