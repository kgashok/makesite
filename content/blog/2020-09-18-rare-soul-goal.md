## Why not aspire to be a rare soul?

![rare](https://bit.ly/35MkvcV)

There are many goals you can set for yourself in life. Goals that you know can bring happiness and satisfy your ego. But then, are those fulfilled goals truly fulfilling? Has it left you in a permanent state of joy or ecstascy? 

Why not aspire to be a rare soul? Not only it is difficult and seems almost unattainable as conveyed by Sri Krishna himself, why would anyone try to achieve that? But then, think about it. If you are going to set a goal, why not set a *ridiculously* high goal?
