<!-- title: Three pronged  -->

## UVP for Edu branding

Three approaches to enhance our UVP, and therefore our brand 

- Zoho-Dyson like Finishing school adapted to our KGISL context as a playbook for talent building and acquisition in a non-formal setting, which will have spill-over effects to students in the formal stream as well

- Evidence of excellence in adapting hackathons-as-the-next higherEdu education model that  again works best in our context of evolution
	- There are hackathons and then there are KGISL hackathons/ We ensure that _every student_  is provided "porridge at the right temperature" so the experience is memorable and more importantly, leaves her craving for more!  

- Even before you start college, join the automation revolution using UiPath-KGISL RPA platform - a unique workshop which delivers a learning experience like no other 
	- help validate to both student and institution about the presence of the problem solving aptitude in a low-code environment
