## UVP for Edu branding

Three actionable approaches to "walk the talk" of the stated UVP, and therefore enhance the brand:

- Zoho-Dyson like Finishing school adapted to our KGISL context as a playbook for talent building and acquisition in a non-formal setting, which will have spill-over effects to students in the formal stream as well
   - primary value is via contagion, opportunity to shadow professionals in the workplace setting; theory and concepts delivered via a combination of faculty / mentors / peers (from formal stream)

- Evidence of excellence in adapting hackathons-as-the-next higherEdu education model that  again works best in our context of evolution
	- There are hackathons and then there are KGISL hackathons. We ensure that _every student_  is provided "porridge at the right temperature" so the experience is memorable and more importantly, leaves her craving for more!  

- Even before you start college, join the automation revolution using UiPath-KGISL RPA platform - a unique immersive workshop which delivers a learning experience like no other 
	- helps validate to both student and institution about the presence of the problem solving aptitude (critical to an aspiring engineer) in a low-code environment
