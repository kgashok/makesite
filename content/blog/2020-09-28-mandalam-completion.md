<!-- title: Mandalam Success  -->

## Consecutive 40 days! 

![mandalam](https://bit.ly/mandalam40)
Happy to report the completion of a mandalam (as defined by Isha) of two sadhanas every day without any break. Today's evening sadhana (completed by 6.32pm, within 20 minutes of the sunset)  was probably one of my most satisfying. 

FYI, continuing for one more day tomorrow to make it 41 consecutive days, just to be sure! 

I have not strived this hard to install any other _worthy_ habit in my whole life. Nor have I been able to maintain the kind of consistency that I did over the past 40 days. 

All due to Sadhguru's grace. 🙏
