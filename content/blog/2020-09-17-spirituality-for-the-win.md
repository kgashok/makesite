_"Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."_  - [Zen](https://lifehacker.com/four-confusing-zen-quotes-and-what-you-can-learn-from-1676177538) quote


## Spiritual myths

Just because you meditate and do yoga, don't expect only good things to happen  to you; just because you meditate, you don’t get any extra willpower - for example, yesterday night, I _happily_ polished off an entire tray of toffifees watching the hapless cyclists gruelling it out on the [brutal Stage 17](https://bit.ly/stage17This) of the [Tour De France 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tour_de_France); just because you meditate, it doesn’t mean you don’t have to diet or do exercise!
-   However, when you meditate, you definitely bring some moments of calmness into your emotional pysche. That calmness definitely helps you gain some  clarity. That mental clarity should definitely help you to think _more_ rationally. Out of greater rationality, you definitely shall see things (_aka_ gain perspective) for what they are. And when you see things for what they are, you will definitely make better decisions for a  _better_  future. 
	- And yes, spirituality will definitely make you _less_ of a delusional narcissistic! 

But, hold on. There is the potential for a big reward: you get to "touch" the intelligence of Creation, and life has the potential to be magical from thereon!
