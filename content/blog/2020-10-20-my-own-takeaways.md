<!-- title: What 2020 taught me -->

## Go with the flow
Don't save up for a rainy day. Live each day fully. Don't expect you to be able to handle the unexpected. Shit happens. Deal with it. 

## Less is less

Aspire to be less. Don't be sick and aspire to be more special than everybody else. Period. And that is okay. Stop being so neurotic. _After 100 years_, no one will remember you did or did not do. Just be nice and kind and tread lightly until it is time for you to move on. 

## Be fully spent by the time the end arrives 
Don't hold back any efforts. Don't be a wimp. Go out and brave everything that Life throws at you. 

## Embrace fully

Embrace _everything_ without an iota of judgment or liking or disliking.


## Learning takes time

And not everyone learns the same way. It is messy at best. So, don't try to "standardize" learning.
