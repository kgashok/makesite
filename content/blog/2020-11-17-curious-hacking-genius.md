<!-- title: Successful learner  -->

## What gives?

```
Follow your Curiosity (FyC)
      to 
CoKreate/Hack your Genius (hKyG)
      to 
Maximize your magic in ~10,000 hrs (MyM)

```

In essence, approach your   
Learning as Adventure and not as Hard Labour

Start with Questions (curiosity driven about problems preferably)
 - -> Problems  (design thinking et al) 
 -  -> Ideas (have good and bad ones, and plenty of them)
 -  -> Hack one or more of them 
 -  -> Skills will ensue, and so will Knowledge
 -  -> Habit creation of questions->ideas->hack->learn->repeat
	 - The power of compounding - become 1% better every day
	 - [http://j.mp/improvementDaily](http://j.mp/improvementDaily) along with Scott Young's brilliant blog on self-improvement [http://bit.ly/selfThis](http://bit.ly/selfThis) 

In short, "Develop the habit of private HACKING (problems+ideas+hack+skills+learn) and publicly participating in hackathons (constraints on time frame to produce a hack for a problem"


## Mission and Vision

- ENVISIONED future - *BECOME what in a constrainted time frame?* Become #1 in delivering more genius per genius to the society to increase prosperity and wealth (medium term outcome)
- IPL-like MISSION - *BE doing what even if not paid any money for it?* - To prepare more talent to meet better opportunities by producing more learning (RFB) 

- STRATEGY/TACTICS: *KnowHow * for how to have Genius happen inside a student? - http://j.mp/hackGenius
  - use this formula 
    - **Skill + No fear + No reward + Unrealistic but strict timeframe = Genius**

- The Million dollar question? Who will do all the above? Who will help us do it faster and quicker than the competition? 


## Two sections
 - KGISL-focused 
	1. make a commitment, follow the instructions to the letter
	2. stipend from semester 1 
	3. can ask for exit until end of semester 4 
		4. no monetary penalties
		6. If exit is asked in semester 5 (beginning of 3rd year), they will have to refund any and all stipends paid
			6. prize money, if any, can be retained by themselves

- Student-focused 
    0. Actively seek out what their curiosity, motivations, intentions are 
	1. vast _exposure_ to other companies, internships, etc 
	4. no stipend during their study is offered by KGiSL
	5. can opt to come to move to "KGISL-focused" section no later than semester 5 (beginning of 3rd year)

**KGISL-focused** students will be provided first-offer for any fresher positions at KGISL. If they accept to take the offer they will offered a higher salary than provided to normal fresher students from other colleges. If they are accepted and paid a higher salary, they will have to commit to a maximum of 24 months service at KGISL.

 Hack, Genius! Or in three words, hack your genius. It all starts with an idea. A hack is a diamond in the rough collaborative implementation of that idea within a short time frame. A hack is very personal and therefore very precious. It is the starting point to bring forth that genius of a contribution that the world desperately needs, right now!

### Linux as hobby, hack and ultimate open source
