<!-- title: Powerful Questions  -->

These are some of the most obvious powerful questions for which you must aspire to find the answers for, and when the answers whenever they become evident to your context, will be a source of great benefit. 

## How to be a Monopolist

### The most powerful question is...

At least for the HE student, for a starting point for starting your self-learning journey, 
> What are you curious about, really? 

Of course, the most powerful question that Ramana Maharishi encouraged his followerto ask of themselves was was, "Who am I?" And reflect on the answers that you get, until you feel connected to the rest of the Universe on the deepest level. 

- What is Who not How and why should it matter to you? 
- How can we get into the 0.01 of the 1%?


### Deal with Questions
- Use flash cards and memcode to feed you questions very rapidly and repeatedly until you get the answers

- Winning in academics is simple: You come with 90% of the questions through a question bank, and you memorize those answers and go vomit it in the exams - it is worthless, but still has to be done
- But winning in life is all about answering questions which you haven't be exposed to before at all
- Even more important is  to coming with your own question and trying to find the answers to that question

You get a degree if you answer everybody else's questions correctly. You get a life when you ask your own questions and not everyone knows what is the right answer, and even more likely, is nobody knows how to given an answer that is appropriate for you.

This is almost as futile as asking the question "Are leaders born or made?" - the more useful question is "How can we create a leader in everybody?"
