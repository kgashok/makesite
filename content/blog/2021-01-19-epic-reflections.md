## Epic Realisations

_"Headspace isn't the absence of goals and dreams. It just means we hold these things lightly , not letting them interfere with the experience of now."_

## 3rd epicKG
[http://bit.ly/3sJAxxB](http://bit.ly/3sJAxxB) - #epicKG - this is the ultimate - For those who are feeling that their life is "painful", yoga/meditation will definitely help. They don't need to believe in God / Spirituality / Sadhguru, you will need to trust only in the methods and that it will help separate between reality and imagination.  Once they are "healed", they can drop the methods as well. And that will be quite okay.


## 2nd epicKG 

The movie metaphor is brilliant - if you cannot handle the suspense...You have come to watch the movie - enjoy every moment of the movie, *yaar*! 
  - And if that doesn't drive home the point, "You seem to prefer to fix the match (like the IPL match fixing scam)."

“If someone is not in yoga, in my understanding, they are not interested in life. They are waiting for death.”  
—————————————————  

They may not realize that consciously, but that is exactly the situation, because they are letting time go by without enhancing their energies. By accumulations your life is not enhanced. Maybe in other people’s eyes you are enhanced. But as a life you are in no way enhanced. Only by enhancing your energy, only by having mastery over your own system, do you have access and a purchase into this life.”  
   - certain people think, yoga, the spiritual process, or spirituality is some kind of disability. That is their understanding, unfortunately. If spirituality was a disability, we should ban it immediately. Why practice a disability? Spirituality is a way of empowering yourself in such a way that we can enhance life to a point where other people will think it is superhuman. 
   - Because as life, we have only two ingredients – there is time and there is energy. Time is rolling away for all of us at the same pace. It is only the energy we can manage.  
  
Yoga is a way of mastering your energy in such a way that if you live for ten years, it looks like you have been here for hundred years – that is the amount of work and activity you did.” [#SadhguruQuotes](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sadhguruquotes/)
