<h2>No Self-Esteem needed!</h2>
<p>Why do you need <em><strong>self-esteem</strong></em>? You are a spec in a small spec of Coimbatore of a spec in the Earth which is a lonely blue dot in the whole wide universe with billions of stars</p>
<ul>
<li>http://bit.ly/esteemSadhguru
<ul>
<li>Just relax, and enjoy the present!

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and for further clarification on your thought processes and how it affects you, listen to <a href="http://bit.ly/thoughtLimits">this</a>.</p>
<h2>It is your business</h2>
<p>Sadhguru: It is your <a href="http://j.mp/businessYours">business</a>!</p>
<p>Officially (as per yogic sciences):</p>
<ul>
<li>if your body becomes Pleasant we call this health</li>
<li>if it becomes very pleasant we call it pleasure</li>
<li>if your mind becomes Pleasant we call this peace</li>
<li>if it becomes very pleasant we call it joy</li>
<li>if your emotions become Pleasant we call it love</li>
<li>if it becomes very pleasant we call it compassion</li>
<li>if your very life energies become Pleasant we call this blissfulness</li>
<li>if it becomes very pleasant we call it ecstasy</li>
<li>if your if your surroundings become Pleasant we call this <strong>success</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Only for this last one: To make our surroundings Pleasant we need
the cooperation of many forces around us; many things have to fall into place.</p>
<ul>
<li>But to keep your body Pleasant mind Pleasant emotion Pleasant your life energy is pleasant it's 100 percent of your business&quot;</li>
<li>It will not be good for &quot;the business&quot; (of pharmaceuticals)</li>
</ul>
