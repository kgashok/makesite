<h2>Parallel processing in Life</h2>
<p>Aka multi-tasking. I have read in multiple places, it is not healthy to do this.</p>
<p>But here's how I do it, and enjoy it.</p>
<ol>
<li>While my French press coffee is brewing for 5 minutes, I go out into the green lawn laden with the morning mist, barefoot and ground myself. While it can be rather boring to simple stand, I do a simple vertical stretch, which again puts pressure on my soles, which improves the grounding. Coffee brews, deep breathing of clean morning air, grounding achieved, stretch done. In the same 5 minutes, I get three things accomplished.</li>
<li>When I have to be in the loo performing my bowel movements, I take a book with me to read some pages of it. This way, I have begun my 5-10 minute read for the day. Bowel movement achieved, reading quota achieved for the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's what I call parallel processing. You call it multi-tasking. Both the same.<br />
I say to-MA-to, you say to-MAH-to. Both the same.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
