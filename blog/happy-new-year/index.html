<h2>Renewed Co-Kreation in 2021</h2>
<p>tl;dr1 Come alive and <strong>co-Kreate</strong> at KG</p>
<p>tl;dr2 <em>Privileged Workshippers, inspired to impact, to co-Kreate Geniuses, to maximize transformation.</em></p>
<p>Hello Impact Workshippers,</p>
<p>On this New Year, let us remind ourselves that we are privileged and inspired to co-Kreate Geniuses, to maximize transformation. In other words, we are all about</p>
<p><code>co-Kreating (K) Geniuses (G)</code></p>
<p>KGiSL Education is an invite to you to come collaborate with a team of  dedicated faculty and motivated peers; to co-create new knowledge (including ideas and skills), primarily through hackathons.  That <code>Kreation</code> shall be the start of a lifelong confidence-building self-learning journey to discovering your unique genius. That genius will manifest you as a self-made crorepati (<code>1,00,00,000</code>) for your family. As you progress towards the right side of <code>90% === .01%</code> or even earlier, you shall eventually visit as the alumni who generously contributes to keep KITE soaring high, as the <code>MIT</code> for India!</p>
<p>Remember, students choose us for the <strong>reliable</strong> learning experience that <em>transforms</em>. They endorse us for who <em>they</em> become.</p>
