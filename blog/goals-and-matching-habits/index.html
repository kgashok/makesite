<h2>Goals enabled by Habits</h2>
<p>Consistent habits need an anchor in the form of a motivated goal. In my case, I had two goals and they were achieved by consistent habits.</p>
<p>After the physician at AIG Hyderabad warned me that I might have to take medication for life, or lose 10% of my body weight, that was a &quot;negative&quot; goal which inspired me to adopt the Amura's way of losing weight. I had to get into the habit of consistently saying no to sugar. Along the way, I also learnt that I could fast for 72 hours and still survive!</p>
<p>Thanks to Sadhguru's constant persuasion and inspiration, I decided to explore the spiritual dimension of life by travelling inward. Strangely, I made this commitment to <em>my own soul</em>, and made it compulsory to remind myself to allow the soul to have its time for 30min of the day (twice a day).</p>
<p>I had learnt the Shambavi MahaMudra during Dec 2018. I did the sadhana for 40 consecutive days, twice a day. I believe that I have sensed a indescribable yet fleeting sense of peacefulness as part of rather chaotic psyche. Continued daily sadhana for the next 6 months should only deepen that sense of inner joy.</p>
<p>Om Nama Sivaya!<br />
Hari Om!</p>
