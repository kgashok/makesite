<h2>Judge Less, Understand More</h2>
<p>Can u judge who is the better person out of these 3?..🤔</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr A - He had friendship with bad politicians, consults astrologers, two wives, chain smoker, drinks eight to 10 times a day..🤨</li>
<li>Mr B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps till noon, used opium in college &amp; drinks whiskey every evening..😟</li>
<li>Mr C - He is a decorated war hero, a vegetarian, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink  and never cheated on his wife..😁</li>
</ul>
<p>You would say Mr.C - right?</p>
<p>But..</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. A was Franklin Roosevelt! ( 32nd President of the USA)</li>
<li>Mr. B was Winston Churchill!! (Former British Prime Minister)</li>
<li>Mr C Was ADOLF HITLER!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Strange but true..
Its risky to judge anyone by his habits ! Character is a complex phenomenon..🤗</p>
<p>So every person in ur life is important, don't judge them, accept them..🤪</p>
<ul>
<li>...The same Boiling Water that hardens the Egg, will Soften the Potato!</li>
<li>It depends upon Individual's reaction To stressful circumstances!..🤔</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy &quot;The Journey&quot; called Life..👆👌</p>
