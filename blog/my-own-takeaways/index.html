<h2>Go with the flow</h2>
<p>Don't save up for a rainy day. Live each day fully. Don't expect you to be able to handle the unexpected. Shit happens. Deal with it.</p>
<h2>Less is less</h2>
<p>Aspire to be less. Don't be sick and aspire to be more special than everybody else. Period. And that is okay. Stop being so neurotic. <em>After 100 years</em>, no one will remember you did or did not do. Just be nice and kind and tread lightly until it is time for you to move on.</p>
<h2>Be fully spent by the time the end arrives</h2>
<p>Don't hold back any efforts. Don't be a wimp. Go out and brave everything that Life throws at you.</p>
<h2>Embrace fully</h2>
<p>Embrace <em>everything</em> without an iota of judgment or liking or disliking.</p>
<h2>Learning takes time</h2>
<p>And not everyone learns the same way. It is messy at best. So, don't try to &quot;standardize&quot; learning.</p>
