<h2>A better Man, A better Soul</h2>
<p>One of my favourite moments from the movie, &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot;. Take a look below:</p>

<p>Melvin Udall:  I've got a really great compliment for you, and it's true.</p>
<p>Carol Connelly:  I'm so afraid you're about to say something awful.</p>
<p>Melvin Udall:  Don't be pessimistic, it's not your style. Okay, here I go: Clearly, a mistake. I've got this, what - ailment? My doctor, a shrink that I used to go to all the time, he says that in fifty or sixty percent of the cases, a pill really helps. I <em>hate</em> pills, very dangerous thing, pills. Hate. I'm using the word &quot;hate&quot; here, about pills. Hate. My compliment is, that night when you came over and told me that you would never... all right, well, you were there, you know what you said. Well, my compliment to you is, the next morning, I started taking the pills.</p>
<p>Carol Connelly:  I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.</p>
<p>Melvin Udall:  You make me want to be a better man.</p>
<h3>A Better Soul</h3>
<p>Just listening to the devotion in Jahnvi Harrison's voice in <a href="http://j.mp/hareKrishna6">http://j.mp/hareKirshna6</a> will make you want to be a better soul.  And listen often enough, it may transform you into that rarest of souls as inspired by <a href="https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/7/verse/3">Chapter 7, Verse 3, Gita</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Amongst thousands of persons, hardly one strives for perfection; and amongst those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows me in truth.</em></p>
