<h2>Alright all the way</h2>
<p>He should get another Oscar just for that speech
http://j.mp/alrightThis</p>
<p>here's a few things about three things
to my account that I need each day
one something to look up to
another is something to look forward to and
another is someone to chase</p>
<p>now first off I want to thank God because that's who I look
up to he's graced my life with opportunities
that I know are not of my hand or any
other human hand he has shown me that</p>
<p>it's a scientific fact that gratitude
reciprocates in the words of a late
Charlie Lawton who said when you got God
you got a friend and that friend is you</p>
<p>to my family that's who and what I look
forward to to my father who I know he's
up there right now with a big pot of
gumbo he's got a lemon meringue pie over
there he's probably in his underwear
he's got a cold can of Miller Lite he's
dancing right
do you dad you taught me what it means
to be a man to my mother who's here
tonight who taught me and my two older
brothers demanded that we respect
ourselves and what we in turn learned
was then we were better able to respect
others thank you for that mama - my wife
Camilla and my kids Levi
Peeta mr. stone the courage and
significance you give me every day I go
out the door is unparalleled you are the
four people in my life I want to make
the most proud of me thank you
and to my hero that's who I chase now
when I was fifteen years old I had a
very important person in my life come to
me and say who's your hero and I said I
got to think about that give me a couple
of weeks I come back two weeks later
this person comes out and says who's
your hero I said I thought about it you
know who it is I said it's me in ten
years
so I turned twenty five ten years later
that same person comes Mingo so you're a
hero and I was like not even close no no
no she said why I said because my heroes
me at 35 so you see every day every week
every month and every year of my life my
heroes always ten years away
I'm never gonna be my hero I'm not gonna
attain that I know I'm not and that's
just fine with me because that keeps me
with somebody to keep on chasing so to
any of us whatever those things are
whatever it is we look up to whatever it
is we look forward to and whoever it is
we're chasing to that I say amen to that
I say &quot;all right all right all right&quot;</p>
