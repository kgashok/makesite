<h1>6 interrogatives</h1>
<p><em>tl;dr</em> To fully come alive <em>before</em> you are completely dead and gone, to offer all of your genius, so you may finally rest in peace!</p>
<p>What -&gt; to come fully alive
Why -&gt; before you are going to be completely dead and gone, very soon
Who -&gt; ask others who have already have been there, done it!
How -&gt; Start with introducing stillness into your life for 20min -&gt; impact the rest of 23.40 hours of the day
When -&gt; first thing in the morning
Which -&gt; Focus on one thought at a moment; focus on one thing and only thing at a time!</p>
<p>And by the way, what is the purpose of life?</p>
<p>To fully come alive
Before you are completely dead and gone
Before your time is done
Act with a sense of urgency
Remember time is short
Act with a sense of urgency and excitement
To offer all of God's gifts to the world
To be fully used up and exhausted
Before you are completely dead and gone
So may live finally rest in peace!</p>
