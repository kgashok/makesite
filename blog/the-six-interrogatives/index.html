<p><em>tl;dr</em> To fully come alive <em>before</em> you are completely dead and gone, to offer all of your genius, so you may finally rest in peace!</p>
<p>What -&gt; to come fully alive<br />
Why -&gt; before you are going to be completely dead and gone, very soon<br />
Who -&gt; ask others who have already have been there, done it!<br />
How -&gt; Start with introducing stillness into your life for   20min -&gt; impact the rest of 23.40 hours of the day<br />
When -&gt; first thing in the morning<br />
Which -&gt; Focus on one thought at a moment; focus on one thing and only thing at a time!</p>
<p>And by the way, what is the purpose of life?</p>
<p>To fully come alive<br />
Before you are completely dead and gone<br />
Before your time is done<br />
Act with a sense of urgency<br />
Remember time is short<br />
Act with a sense of urgency and excitement<br />
To offer all of God's gifts to the world<br />
To be fully used up and exhausted<br />
Before you are completely dead and gone<br />
So may live finally rest in peace!</p>
