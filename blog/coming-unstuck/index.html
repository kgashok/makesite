<h1>Pongal insight</h1>
<p><code>tl;dr The Joy-&gt;Imagine-&gt;Hack cycle will help you come unstuck from your fate.</code></p>
<p><em>#SoFateLoFocusMoFast</em></p>
<p>99% of us aren't as joyful as we can be (because science has conclusive evidence that it is in our nature to be driven by fate <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45159747-the-science-of-fate"><code>#SoFate</code></a>). That's why you need Sadhguru's SMM yoga. When SMM is practised regularly, it will help you come unstuck from that fate, and instead, come alive with joy from the <em>inside</em>. And from that joy shall emanate your unique imagination, and that imagination shall flow into action (aka <em>hack</em>), which in turn, will deposit precious moments of joy into your human existence. And that my child, is how you kickstart a virtuous cycle within you. If you have deep humility (to accept what the seers have said) and immense patience to follow through, eventually this cycle (<code>Joy-&gt;Imagine-&gt;Hack</code>) shall pull you out of whatever quagmire (real or otherwise) you are stuck in.</p>
<p>Jai Jai Panduranga Vittale! Hare Krishna!</p>
<p>PS: If the <code>joy-&gt;imagine-&gt;hack</code> cycle is beyond you right now, say the Mahamantra <a href="http://j.mp/hareKrishna6">http://j.mp/hareKrishna6</a> at least 11 times a day (and that shouldn't take you ~3 minutes to do that).</p>
<p>PPS: If you don't know the Mahamantra or don't have the Faith in it yet, call whomsoever you know cares for you, for example, it could an elderly couple (who is stuck at home due to corona) and make them happy, and that should also put some joy into your heart. Hari OM!</p>
<p>In addition to any of the above, start saying <code>ராம ராம ராம </code> just for a couple of minutes. Witness an instantaneous uplifting of your spirits.</p>
