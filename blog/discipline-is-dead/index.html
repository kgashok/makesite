<h2>Discipline is dead. Long live Discipline!</h2>
<p>For the first time in my life, I have succeeded in instilling a habit into my life. Thanks to the grace of Sadhguru, I am now finishing two months of consecutive sadhana sessions, not counting 1-2 lapses in the past two months.</p>
<ul>
<li>when there is a will, there is a way</li>
<li>I have had to incorporate some additional pre-prep exercises to make sure that I can sit in Siddhasana without discomfort; I am also doing some mudra practices before starting suga kriya; Muruga Prabu (Physio) helped with his functional training inputs</li>
<li>Choose a habit that is aligned with your <em>true nature</em>. Initially, you will require discipline, lots of it</li>
<li>Eventually, once your <em>true nature</em> gets a taste of the habits impact, your nature conspires to make it part of your routine, without much willpower on need for instrinsic discipline</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not unlike the situation where when you like a person, you tend to want to talk to her or him as often as you can during the week or during the same day. Similarly, if the habit is aligned with what your true nature wants, it will automatically find a way to be in your routine.</p>
<p>So, while discipline is initially critically to establish a habit, if it continues to be required on an ongoing basis, the habit is probably not meant for you.</p>
