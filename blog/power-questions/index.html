<p>What is relevant to me as the <code>CLO</code> (Chief Learning Officer) is</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you learning as fast as the world is changing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Purely coincidentally that there is an HBR article will the same title <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/01/are-you-learning-as-fast-as-th">https://hbr.org/2012/01/are-you-learning-as-fast-as-th</a>!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mycii.in/Image/EventImages/EventMainImages/E000021582_Banner_banner1%20-%20Copy.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="https://quotefancy.com/media/wallpaper/1600x900/3255627-Hopsin-Quote-We-need-to-make-a-change-while-there-s-still-time-it.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi's most enduring quote for personal transformation was: &quot;Be the Change you want to see in the world&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Jackson's most meaningful song for me was &quot; Man in the Mirror&quot; CII Coimbatore asked this seemingly enduring question as early as in 2014, and seemed very relevant at that time. Is there an altogether more relevant question to ask? Or how can it be tweaked ever so slightly to make it even more powerful?
<ul>
<li>Through 2014-2016, CII's <code>Connect Coimbatore</code> event asked the pragmatic question, &quot;Are you learning as fast as the world is changing?&quot;. It probably encouraged enough action to stay relevant in an increasingly VUCA world. However in the post-pandemic era beginning 2021, should we provoke with a more powerful question?
<ul>
<li>Consider this: &quot;What/Who will help you be the Disruption you want to cause in the world?&quot;
<ul>
<li>What technology will help you navigate the <code>DOT</code> (disruption, opportunities and threats) in a post-pandemic VUCA world?</li>
<li>why not be the disruption you anticipate in the future?</li>
<li>what technologies will help you anticipate disruption, seize opportunities and manage threats in the future?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And while you are hungry to see the impact of your Disruption, don't forget there are many that go hungry without a choice. Don't you forget it is just another day for you and me in Paradise.</p>

<p>These are some of the most obvious powerful questions for which you must aspire to find the answers for, and when the answers whenever they become evident to your context, will be a source of great benefit.</p>
<h2>How to be a Monopolist</h2>
<p>How to think, act and win like a monopolist?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the win? Effortless profits for a very long period of time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Automation First</h2>
<p>What is one repeating problem you can automate or eliminate today?</p>
<h2>Who not How</h2>
<p>Find out &quot;Who&quot; can help you accomplish what you need to get done. Don't figure out &quot;How&quot; all the time...&quot;Who can help me do this?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>stop being transactional, and start thinking transformational</li>
<li>Idayam oils Muthu - his quote about &quot;Customer as God&quot; - used it to present the story on &quot;Workship&quot; - for my core team members</li>
</ul>
<h2>F&amp;*#ing disrupt yourself</h2>
<h2>What is your morning routine?</h2>
<h2>What projects can I create in 5 lines of code?</h2>
<h2>What other questions? From James Clear</h2>
<p>Borrow and publish - what would be relevant to students of Artificial Intelligence?</p>
<p>![artQuest](<img src="https://files.gitter.im/581c97cbd73408ce4f339dc2/Iitr/Screenshot-2020-11-15-at-08.52.03.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>The most powerful question is...</h3>
<p>At least for the HE student, for a starting point for starting your self-learning journey,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are you curious about, really?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the most powerful question that Ramana Maharishi encouraged his followerto ask of themselves was was, &quot;Who am I?&quot; And reflect on the answers that you get, until you feel connected to the rest of the Universe on the deepest level.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Who not How and why should it matter to you?</li>
<li>How can we get into the 0.01 of the 1%?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deal with Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use flash cards and memcode to feed you questions very rapidly and repeatedly until you get the answers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winning in academics is simple: You come with 90% of the questions through a question bank, and you memorize those answers and go vomit it in the exams - it is worthless, but still has to be done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But winning in life is all about answering questions which you haven't be exposed to before at all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even more important is  to coming with your own question and trying to find the answers to that question</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You get a degree if you answer everybody else's questions correctly. You get a life when you ask your own questions and not everyone knows what is the right answer, and even more likely, is nobody knows how to given an answer that is appropriate for you.</p>

<h3>Dalio on Meditation</h3>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/UzehRUSUd30?t=3414">meditation by Dalio</a></p>
<ul>

<li>Creativity (connection to the subconscious)</li>
</ul>

<h3></h3>
<p>Life 3.0 Book premise is based on a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens when humans are no longer the smartest species on the planet? #life3</p>

<h2>‚ÄúHow can you achieve your 10 year plan in the next 6 months?‚Äù ‚Äî Peter Thiel</h2>

<h2>Nuture vs Nature</h2>
<p>This is almost as futile as asking the question &quot;Are leaders born or made?&quot; - the more useful question is &quot;How can we create a leader in everybody?&quot;</p>
<p>Be still as a deep sea, stable as a rock, calm as a Sky; and then Act: you will see yourself creating magic. üåü‚ò∫Ô∏è. Inner stability in the present time is the key to peace and harmony in our interactions and relations with self, family, profession and nature. üå∏üçÄ‚ú®.  Few moments  of silence  and meditation in the morning and night is the magic üîë key. ‚ú®üåº. I am a powerful, peaceful, happy and pure soul; üåü. It nurtures, empowers and heals. Do you have few minutes to nurture yourself ? Om Shanti üåª‚ò∫Ô∏è
Dr .Mohit.D.Gupta</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a few minutes to nurture yourself
To change what seems like a fateful nature
So you may claim what is your rightful divine future?
Om Shanti üåª‚ò∫Ô∏è
<code>#yogicNutureDivineNature</code></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>Still break of the day   
A yogic future nurture  
Watching the nature


Yogic nurture
to overcome fateful nature
divine future waits
</code></pre>
