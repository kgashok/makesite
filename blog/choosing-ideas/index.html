<h2>Prioritizing ideas that would benefit most from your focus</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be frustrated that you are not doing the right kind of work that you should be doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be unsure of how to choose what you should focus on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is not all easy to figure out about your big roles</p>
<ul>
<li>it is not easy to define the sub-projects should be</li>
<li>there is no shortcut / process it, think about it, cognitive integration that requires time alone with your thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalling</p>
<ul>
<li>even if you are not a writer - writing is very powerful, you are overcoming the working memory limitation - extra buffer to hold ideas
<ul>
<li>write about all your frustration and thoughts in a journal setting for 20 minutes - I was really confused about this</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>have a pocket notebook / fancy pin / Jack brand / should come with you / lifeBook / above tasks / what should I be doing in my life</p>
<ul>
<li>different notebooks / different homes / a theme that I want to explore. Monthly go through your physical book and transfer into the digital permanent system / takes about 1 hour every month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smartphones accidentally got rid off the time when you could be thinking, understanding what went wrong, what that means, what are you happy about, what are you unhappy about</p>
<ul>
<li>record of reflection of being alone with your thoughts</li>
<li>you lose an opportunity to achieve self understanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
