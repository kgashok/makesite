<li>The one-inch leverage</li>
</ol>
<p>Just one inch of pillow helped me to stay focused on completing my 40-mandala of SMM yoga. What a difference, between night and day! I am feeling more settled during the entire sadhana...</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The every-minute-planning experience</li>
</ol>
<p>I am going to schedule every single minute of my day for a couple of days.</p>
<p>And see how productive that becomes. This again comes from my own motivation to do the SMM yoga at the twilight zones. Need to plan my mornings properly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Seeing things for what they are</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems persist and are not addressed over 5 years. And they become insurmountable like mountains. Stop lamenting about them or pointing fingers are people who might be causing them. Rather, face the issues head-on. They can be reduced to molehills by chipping away at the base. With enormous patience, for over a duration of not longer than you let the problem fester along.</p>
<p>Example - with the right diet, whatever weight one gained over 25 years, it can be ceded in less than 6 months. New insight, new mentoring, a new approach, new motivation, new inspiration - things fall into place.</p>
