<p>Start with Questions (curiosity driven about problems preferably)</p>
<ul>
<li>-&gt; Problems  (design thinking et al)</li>
<li>-&gt; Ideas (have good and bad ones, and plenty of them)</li>
<li>-&gt; Hack one or more of them</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, &quot;Develop the habit of private HACKING (problems+ideas+hack+skills+learn) and publicly participating in hackathons (constraints on time frame to produce a hack for a problem&quot;</p>
<h2>Mission and Vision</h2>

</li>
<li>
<p>STRATEGY/TACTICS: *KnowHow * for how to have Genius happen inside a student? - http://j.mp/hackGenius</p>

<li>use this formula
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill + No fear + No reward + Unrealistic but strict timeframe = Genius</strong></li>
