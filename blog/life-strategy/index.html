<h2>Effortless : Pray to Perumal</h2>
<ol>
<li>Please keep me happy
<ul>
<li>God will grant you what <em>you</em> need; not what you think you want</li>
<li>Don't compare what you get - after all, you don't know what you want; it is meaningless to compare yourself to others way of life and lifestyle - even if you had it, it might bring you more misery than happiness that you might want</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>less is not more. Less is Less. And that is perfectly fine. Minimalism as a way of life, not as a means to an end but as end in of itself
<ul>
<li>Define what you are not like Mathew does - https://bit.ly/eliminateThis</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create some balance in life - for example, three broad areas and spend time in all three areas
<ul>
<li>work</li>
<li>family</li>
<li>friends</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Alternative Effortful Approach</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ask the right type of questions - intelligent questions, please!</p>
<ul>
<li>how to make sure we maintain financial security
<ul>
<li>living and fleeting with risk ever so slightly</li>
<li>playing it safe</li>
<li>a slow death</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how to think act and execute like a monopolist?</li>
<li>Don't ask &quot;How can I be happier?&quot;
<ul>
<li>determine what will make you happy, and find out &quot;how can I learn to do it today? Quickly?&quot;</li>
<li>How Mathew McConaughey defines happiness <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmCTQ_mkzHU&amp;t=446s">https://bit.ly/mathewHappy</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make some decisions - break away from the past activities</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is okay to go hungry for 72 hours - completely mind blown that my body had the spare calories within it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;less food the better&quot; - new belief</p>
<ul>
<li>the less sweeter it is, the better</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;less is less&quot; - LIFE is about FOCUS - don't try to too much, please, it is not good for your heart</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain the discipline to follow through on your decisions</p>
<ul>
<li>Death by a 1000 cuts</li>
<li>Goal by a 1000 hacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less is less - like a hobo</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>I basically have the material needs of a hobo. Except that I need my organic single estate french press grind coffee to be brewed at approximately 84 degrees C for 4:40 min, no more, no less.</p>
