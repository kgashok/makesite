<h2>How to get to the Centre</h2>
<p><em>People come as investigators</em><br />
<em>Then they become students</em><br />
<em>Then they become disciples and then eventually</em><br />
<em>They become devotees</em><br />
<em>As their journey inward deepens!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Tbha9WYxcg4">Sadhguru</a></li>
</ul>
<p>... and if you are still unconvinced, listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/6i8bnb4dvvg">Osho</a></p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - keep observing your actions, thoughts and emotions as a bystander, and the 4th step &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; shall happen <em><strong>automagically</strong></em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Observing all your activities
<ul>
<li>Your body, your action</li>
<li>Don't do it like a robot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch the activities of your mind
<ul>
<li>thoughts, dreams, imagination
<ul>
<li>Don't make judgments - just like you are standing by the road, watching a procession</li>
<li>Just like a mirror does not say &quot;Beautiful face&quot; or &quot;My God! Ugly face&quot;</li>
<li>Become a pure witness, no evaluation of good or bad</li>
<li>10% of witness, 90% of thoughts</li>
<li>90% of witness, 10% thoughts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At 100% witness
4. Doorstep to the 3rd step
5. &quot;Moods&quot; - a certain shadow of sadness, joy
6. Watch the third - related to the &quot;heart&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Eventually, you will enter the 4th stage. Ultimate ecstascy. Samadhi. Enlightenment.  Consciousness is aware of itself. There is no way to go beyond it - You have come home!</p>
<p>This needs no belief. It only needs experimentation. I want you to experiment and experience the experiment.</p>
<p>You are still asleep. I am just awake.
No need to worship me. I will stand a guarantee, I will be your encouragement, I will not be your saviour. I will do my best to shake you and wake you up!</p>
<p><strong>Tomorrow Never Comes</strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/IshaUSA/videos/1531261760256590/?v=1531261760256590">Sadhguru</a> shares his poem about tomorrow and speaks about tomorrow as an idea, not a reality. This moment is the only reality. Tomorrow never happened to anybody but the idea of tomorrow has robbed a huge mass of people of their life.</em></p>
<p>A day that never came but has managed to spoil every game<br />
One day that takes all the blame, the basis of all fear and shame<br />
Cripples the blossoming of the life’s flame<br />
A spoiler that makes life a dream<br />
Traps the limitless in a limited scene<br />
One day that takes all the blame, the basis of all fear and shame<br />
Cripples the blossoming of life’s flame<br />
A spoiler that makes life a dream<br />
Traps the limitless in a limited scene<br />
A day that never comes but the world it rules<br />
A day that never comes but the world it rules.</p>
