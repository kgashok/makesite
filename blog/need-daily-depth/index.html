<h1>Read two chapter every day</h1>
<p>In his blog <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/08/27/focus-week-rediscover-depth">https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/08/27/focus-week-rediscover-depth</a>, Newport suggests that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>read two chapters from a book every day; with at least one of the chapters read in a scenic or otherwise interesting setting.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If youâ€™ve been splashing in a world of distracting shallowness since March, you may need to ease back into regular engagement with complicated material. I would suggest starting with books that are easy to read, such as popular novels, or narrative non-fiction, or advice writing. As you complete each book, however, raise the difficulty of the next. Your goal is to get to a place where the two chapters consumed each day really push your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Good suggestion. Will try adopting this soon.</p>
