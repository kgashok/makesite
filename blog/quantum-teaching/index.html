<h2>Quantum concepts</h2>
<ol>
<li>Subatomic particles are present as matter and wave, at the same time</li>
<li>Quantum tunneling, the reason why fusion is possible in the Sun, and we gain energy</li>
<li>Superposition - the ability to spin in both directions at the same time</li>
</ol>
<p>It is ironical how such abstract and counterintuitive concepts are so practically useful in our day-to-day lives!</p>
<h3>Principles of Scientific Communication</h3>

<p>Four principles of technical communication:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start at the right point (From Known to Unknown) - &quot;show of hands&quot; - err on the side of caution</li>
<li>Don't go too far into the rabbit hole - explain 3 things that pique interest rather than a whole load of information  (or if it is more than 3, then use clustering to reduce it to three)</li>
<li>Clarity is better than Accuracy - iron out the finer details later   (iteratively, provide more details, for e.g. teaching sorting as a use-case before going into the theoretical aspects of the tree)</li>
<li>Explain why it is &quot;cool&quot; - enthusiasm is key (provide the exciting answer to &quot;Why should I bother knowing this?&quot; with a real-world use case)</li>
</ol>
<p>Most importantly, convey &quot;It is not about whether you are good or bad at it, it is all about being interested in it!&quot;</p>
<h3>Three Sciences</h3>
<ul>
<li>Science of Fasting</li>
<li>Science of Focus</li>
<li>Science of Fate</li>
</ul>
