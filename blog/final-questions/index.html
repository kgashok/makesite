<p class="meta">Published on 2020-10-27 by <b>Ashok Be</b></p>
<h2>Questions, questions</h2>
<p>I was curious to build a wordcloud based on <a href="https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question">https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question</a> using the following JavaScript code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var err = [], res = &quot;&quot;; for (var x = 2; x &lt;= 285; x++) { 
  var select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + &quot;) &gt; div:nth-child(4) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;);
  if (select === null) {
     select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + 
&quot;) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;);  
  }
  if (select === null) {
  var select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + &quot;) &gt; div:nth-child(2) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;); 
  }
  if (select === null) err.push(x); 
  else {
    console.log(x, select);
    var text = select.textContent.replace(/\?/g,'? ');
    //var text = select.textContent;
    res += text;
  } 
}
console.log(res);
console.log(err.length, err); 
</code></pre>
<p>And the 280+ questions are available in one big blob:</p>
