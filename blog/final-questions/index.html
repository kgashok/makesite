<p class="meta">Published on 2020-10-27 by <b>Ashok Be</b></p>
<h2>Questions, questions</h2>
<p>I was curious to build a wordcloud based on <a href="https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question">https://www.edge.org/responses/what-is-the-last-question</a> using the following JavaScript code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var err = [], res = &quot;&quot;; for (var x = 2; x &lt;= 285; x++) { 
  var select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + &quot;) &gt; div:nth-child(4) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;);
  if (select === null) {
     select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + 
&quot;) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;);  
  }
  if (select === null) {
  var select = document.querySelector(&quot;#block-system-main &gt; div:nth-child(&quot; + x + &quot;) &gt; div:nth-child(2) &gt; p &gt; strong&quot;); 
  }
  if (select === null) err.push(x); 
  else {
    console.log(x, select);
    var text = select.textContent.replace(/\?/g,'? ');
    //var text = select.textContent;
    res += text;
  } 
}
console.log(res);
console.log(err.length, err); 
</code></pre>
<p>And the 280+ questions are available in one big blob:</p>
<p>Can we program a computer to find a 10,000-bit string that encodes more actionable wisdom than any human has ever expressed? Are complex biological neural systems fundamentally unpredictable?  Are the simplest bits of information in the brain stored at the level of the neuron? How can we put rational prices on human lives without becoming inhuman? How will we build the tools to maintain the software in long-lived online devices that can kill us? Are people who cheat vital to driving progress in human societies? How do we best build a civilization that is galvanized by long-term thinking? How would changes in the marginal tax rate affect our efforts and motivation? Will it ever be possible for us to transcend our limited experience of time as linear? Does consciousness reside only in our brains? How can science best leverage unreason to overcome the heroic passion for war? What is the optimal algorithm for discovering truth? Will the appearance of new species of talented computational intelligence result in improving the moral behavior of persons and societies? Can we re-design our education system based on the principle of neurodiversity? How does a single human brain architecture create many kinds of human minds? What would a diagram that gave a complete understanding of imagination need to be? What libraries will we have to build when cloning becomes infinitely expandable? Will the process of discovery be completed in any of the natural sciences? What is the hard limit on human longevity? Will we ever live together in a hive? What kinds of minds could solve the mind-body problem? Will AI make the Luddites (mostly) right? Why are we so often kind to strangers when nobody is watching and we have nothing to gain? How much biodiversity do we need? Is there a way for humans to directly experience what it’s like to be another entity? Will a machine ever be able to feel what an organism feels? Which questions should we not ask and not try to answer? Can wild animals that are large and dangerous be made averse to threatening humans? Can consciousness exist in an entity without a self-contained physical body? Will scientific advances about the causes of sexual conflict help to end the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot;? How do I describe the achievements, meanings, and power of Beethoven's piano sonata “Appassionata”? When will we accept that the most accurate clocks will have to advance regularly sometimes, irregularly most of the time, and at times run counterclockwise? How complex must be the initial design of the simplest machine that can learn from experience to achieve, at a minimum, the intelligence and abilities of a typical human being? How can we design a machine that can correctly answer every question, including this one? What new methodology will be required to explain the neural basis of consciousness? Is there a fundamental difference between the biological world and the physical world? Can we design a modern society without money which is at least as effective economically and politically as our current system? Will some things about life, consciousness, and society necessarily remain unseen? Is the unipolar future of a &quot;singleton&quot; the inevitable destiny of intelligent life?

Could the thermodynamic prophecy of an increasingly entropic universe be fulfilled by the cosmic flourishing of intelligent life? What future progressive norms would most forward-thinking people today dismiss as too transgressive? If we want to make a real and effective science-based policy, should we change politics or science? Is our brain fundamentally limited in its ability to understand the external world? How can an aggregation of trillions of selfish, myopic cells discover the unwitting teamwork that turns that dynamic clump into a person who can love, notice, wonder, and keep a promise? Are accurate mathematical theories of individual human behavior possible? Are the ways qualia relate to computation, creativity to free will, risk to probability, morality to epistemology, all the same question? Can we develop a procedure that, in principle, would tell us whether or not our universe is a simulation (analogous to the way the now proven Poincaré Conjecture can tell us the universe’s shape)? Why is there such widespread public opposition to science and scientific reasoning in the United States, the world leader in every major branch of science? Will a computer ever really understand and experience human kindness? Does this question exist in a parallel universe? How will we know if we achieve universal happiness? Is it ultimately possible for life to bend the shape of the universe to fit life's purposes, as we are now bending the shape of our environment here on earth? Why are there no trees in the ocean? Can we create new senses for humans—not just touch, taste, vision, hearing, smell, but totally novel qualia for which we don't yet have words? Will we ever be replaced by another earthly species capable of evolving to a similar degree of social and technical sophistication that effectively fills the biocultural niche we vacated? Is the cumulation of shared knowledge forever constrained by the limits of human language? Have we left the Age of Reason, never to return? So, before The Singularity...? Will civilization collapse before I die? Will humans ever embrace their own diversity? Is there a place for our past in our future?

What will courtship, mate selection, length of marriages, and family composition and networks be like when we are all living over 150 years? Can we design a common test to assess machine, animal and human intelligence? Will the &quot;third culture&quot; be followed by a fourth culture, a fifth culture, and, ominously, a Final Culture? Is there a single, evolved biological mechanism that can be tweaked to improve overall health, cognitive abilities, and slow aging? Why is the phenomenon too familiar to investigate the hardest thing to completely understand? Is intersubjectivity possible in a quantum mechanical universe? Is there a Turing test for living rather than thinking that can distinguish animate from automata? What behaviors are we attributing only to brain mechanisms that may be better explained by considering biomechanics? Is there a single theory of all physics (TOP), and what is it? Can human intuition ever be reduced to an algorithm? How much time will pass between the last minute before artificial superintelligence and the first minute after it? Can we acquire complete access to our unconscious minds? Is it possible to control a system capable of evolving? If we're not the agents of ourselves (and it's hard to see how we can be), how can we make sense of moral accountability (and how can we live coherently without it)? Is there a subtle form of consciousness that operates independent of brain function? How can the few pounds of grey goo between our ears let us make utterly surprising, completely unprecedented, and remarkably true discoveries about the world around us, in every domain and at every scale, from quarks to quasars?

What proportion of &quot;ethnic&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; tensions are rooted in our genes? Are humans capable of building a moral economy? Is gravity a fundamental law of nature, or does gravity—and thereby spacetime—emerge as a consequence of the underlying quantum nature of reality?

How and when will it end or will it persist indefinitely? Is there an ultimate reality? Given the nature of life, the purposeless indifference of the universe, and our complete lack of free will, how is it that most people avoid ever being clinically depressed?</p>
